# Python-Instacart-Analysis
## Project Overview: This project delivers a comprehensive Marketing Analysis using a structured, end-to-end analytics workflow. The analysis evaluates customer engagement, campaign performance, retention behavior, and regional trends to identify actionable opportunities for improving marketing ROI and operational decision-making.

Instacart, an online grocery store app, seeks to enhance its understanding of sales patterns through exploratory data analysis. With a focus on customer segmentation and purchasing behaviors, the goal is to inform targeted marketing strategies for continued growth and optimization.

Using a combination of data wrangling, validation checks, derived marketing indicators, and visualizations, this project provides a complete, insight-driven interpretation of customer behavior across multiple segments.

# Key Questions
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
  - Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

# Dataset
- orders
- products
- departments
- orders_products
- customers

# Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- Seaborn: for data visualizations
- Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations

# Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:
- 01 Project Management: Project Brief & Data Dictionary.
- 02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)
- 03 Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.
- 04 Analysis: Separated into two subfolders Reports and Visualizations. The Reports subfolder contains crosstabs and the Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- 05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel
