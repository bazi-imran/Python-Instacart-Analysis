Instacart, an online grocery store app, seeks to enhance its understanding of sales patterns through exploratory data analysis. With a focus on customer segmentation and purchasing behaviors, the goal is to inform targeted marketing strategies for continued growth and optimization.

Using a combination of data wrangling, validation checks, derived marketing indicators, and visualizations, this project provides a complete, insight-driven interpretation of customer behavior across multiple segments.

## Project Objectives: 
- Clean, validate, and standardize raw marketing activity data 
- Build derived features to segment customers by loyalty, spending, and frequency
- Visualize marketing performance trends across product categories and customer groups
- Identify high-value customer segments for targeted engagement
- Provide strategic recommendations based on observed patterns

## Key Business Questions: 
### Customer Timing & Behavior: 
- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
- At what times of day do customers spend the most money?
### Product Strategy:
- How can product prices be grouped into simpler ranges to guide targeted promotions?
- Which product types or departments are the most popular?
### Customer Segments:
- How is customer loyalty distributed?
- Do ordering habits vary by loyalty status?
- Are there behavioral differences across customer regions?
- Is there a connection between age, income, and family status?
- What demographic classifications naturally emerge?
- How do ordering habits differ across customer profiles?

#### Dataset: 
- orders
- products
- departments
- orders_products
- customers

## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- Seaborn: for data visualizations
- Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations

## Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:
- 01 Project Management: Project Brief & Data Dictionary.
- 02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)
- 03 Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.
- 04 Analysis: Separated into two subfolders Reports and Visualizations. The Reports subfolder contains crosstabs and the Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- 05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel
