# Python-Instacart-Analysis
For my data project, I analyzed Instacart trends using Python. After cleaning and exploring multiple datasets, I created a report with insights and recommendations for Instacart's key questions.

Instacart, an online grocery store app, seeks to enhance its understanding of sales patterns through exploratory data analysis. With a focus on customer segmentation and purchasing behaviors, the goal is to inform targeted marketing strategies for continued growth and optimization.

# Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- Seaborn: for data visualizations
- Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations

# Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:
- 01 Project Management: Project Brief & Data Dictionary.
- 02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)
- 03 Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.
- 04 Analysis: Separated into two subfolders Reports and Visualizations. The Reports subfolder contains crosstabs and the Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- 05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel
